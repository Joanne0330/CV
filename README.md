## About Me

I am a energetic software developer who is creative, driven and passionate about what I do. Coming from a background of classical music, I know how to transform a desire from wanting to be good at something, wanting to create something amazing to acutually achieving these goals. I've experienced the discipline, the methodical planning, and the motivation that is needed for endless learning process such as music. Now, as a coder, I am transfering those skills and experience from music to software building, creating apps in hopes to transform the lives around us.
