## Joanne Chen

Organised, passionate, attention to details, I am a unique software developer whose dev background actually started with 14 years of experience as a classical musician, performing world class concerts all over the world. From concert halls to my computer, culture to the tech world, the structure, creativity and the elegance in both music and in software are equally facinating to me. 

## Trained professional, I mean, really professional

Many dream of being a musician but it takes a character to be a professional. It shows how a passion transforms into determination and pereverence, as well as courage to face both boring repetition and difficult challenges, to finding the patience to achieve the ultimate perfection, if there's ever such a thing as perfection.

#### Flexible working mode: solo or team

- Achievements

#### Teaching

My 15 years of teaching experiences enabled me many skills which are crucial in the dev world:

- Observation: What works, what doesn't. Finding out areas needing improvment.
- Analytical: Analysing areas of problem. Mapping out a plan, or solution. 
- Problem solve: Not just problem solve, but also help and teach others how to problem solve.
- Communication: explain in details and in clear progression how things should be proceed and achieved.
