## About Me

If you read through my CV you'll see that I come from a background of classical music. Slightly unusual? Perhaps. It is not a secret that I've always loved and enjoyed the beauty and the complexity of this fine art, but what's unusual is that I absolutely LOVE practicing more than anything. I love making progress, learning something from scratch to performing this master piece to the highest technical and musical level I can achieve. I love planning and finding my own way in making good progress, in a intellectual and methodical way to achieve the ultimate goal step by step and in a orderly fashion so no time and engergy is wasted. The result is rewarding but it's the journey that's is worth living for.

Am I really that odd? I'm not so sure...

A few friends suggested that I should checkout coding. I looked into it and the rest is history. With great determination, I got myself in Makers Academy coding bootcamp in just a few weeks, and 4 months later, I started to build full-stack softwares in small teams. The more I build the more I want to learn. I am excited by the challenging complexity and how each element of codes intertwines with one another. I want to continue building and expressing my creativity through the software building, in hopes that what I create with my team and my company, can help make a difference in people's lives
