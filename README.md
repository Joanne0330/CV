## About Me

If you read through my CV you'll see that I come from a background of classical music. Unusual? Perhaps. To me, this form of fine art is irresistable, but what I love the most from it is actually practicing. I LOVE making progress, learning something new, and building up my ability to perform any piece of music from scratch and bring it to the highest level I can achieve. I love planning and finding ways to improve methodically to achieve the ultimate goal step by step. Repetition is necessary but it must be done intellectually so that no time and engergy is wasted... 

And then coding came along...

A few friends suggested that I should checkout coding. I looked into it and the rest is history. I am excited by it for the same reasons as I love practicing and now all I want to do is to become a great developer. I got myself in Makers Academy coding bootcamp just 3 weeks after I started coding, and now I'm building full-stack softwares after 4 months of training. The more I build the more I want to learn. I cannot wait to continue building creative apps that are cool, easy to use and life changing for their users.
